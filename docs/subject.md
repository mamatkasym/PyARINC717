The `Flight Data Recorder` (FDR) system records the critical flight data parameters necessary to support 
an investigation of the condition of the aircraft.

The various parameters to be recorded are acquired by the Data Concentrator Unit (DCU) Module Cabinet (DMC), which acts 
as a Flight Data Acquisition Unit, and then streams the data in a defined sequence of 1024 words per second as 
per ARINC 717.

The recorder is designed to keep the last 25 hours of information in a crash-survivable memory.

With the incorporation of Avionics Software Version 5.4 (Avionics Build 8.0 A1), there will be some minor changes to 
the parameter list, which will be addressed by introducing a new ROSE Interpretation Database.
